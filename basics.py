# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
# Real-World Use Cases
# 1. Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask are used to build web applications.
# 2. Data Science: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are widely used for data analysis and visualization.
# 3. Machine Learning: TensorFlow and Scikit-learn are popular libraries for building
#    machine learning models.
# 4. Automation: Python scripts are often used to automate repetitive tasks.
# 5. Scripting: Python is commonly used for writing small scripts to perform various tasks.
# 6. Game Development: Libraries like Pygame are used for developing simple games.

print("Basics of Python ")
# This is a simple Python program that prints a message to the console.
print("Hello,world!")
# The print() function is used to output text to the console.

comment = "This is a comment in Python"
# Comments are used to explain code and are ignored by the Python interpreter.
# In Python, comments start with the '#' symbol.
# They can be placed on their own line or at the end of a line of code.
print(comment)

# your task is to learn and practice these basics to build a strong foundation in Python programming.
print("YOUR NAME ")
print("YOUR ROLL NUMBER ")
# Learning these basics is essential for anyone starting with Python programming.
print("geeta raut")
print("209394")

# Understanding these fundamentals will help you write efficient and effective Python code.
# initialization of variables in python is very simple. You just need to assign a value to a variable name using the equal sign (=). dont need to declare 
# the data type of the variable
name = "geeta"
job = 'student'
bio = """I am a student learning Python programming."""
age = 20

print(name,job,bio,age)
# in python ,you use a "" , '' or """ """ to define string variables.
# Triple quotes (""" or ''') are used for multi-line strings or docstrings.
print("\n Data Types in Python :")
# Python has several built-in data types, including:
# 1. int: Integer type, used to represent whole numbers.
num1 = 10
print("\ninterger data type:",num1)
num2 = 2.0
print("\nfloat data type:",num2)
# 2. float: Floating-point type, used to represent decimal numbers.
# wecan check it using type() function
print("\nType of num1:",type(num1))
print("\nType of num2:",type(num2))

# also we can find the memory address of a variable using id() function 
print(id(num1))
print(id(num2))

# now you try it yourself
